### Checkers
#### Description and background of the game
* Setup: Checkers game is setup on a 8 x 8 chessbaord that consists of light square and dark square.  Each players start with 12 pieces that can only be situated or moved on dark squares. (see Screenshot #1 below for initial setup)
* Turn: Each player can move one piece in a turn.  Once a piece is moved by a player, it will be another player's turn to make a move.  
* Move: A piece can either move one spot diagonally forward (toward opponent's side), or jump to second spots ahead if an opponent's piece sits on the immediate corner.  The opponent's piece being jumped over is captured. (see Screenshot #2 below for potential move)
* King: When a piece is moved to the furthest row towards opponent's side, it turns to a king piece.  A king piece can move both foreward and backward. (see Screenshot #3 below for king piece)
* Win: You win once all opponent's pieces are captured, and lose once all your own pieces are captured. (see Screenshot #4 below for a win)
